# Matrix: Implementation and Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the implementation details and development roadmap for Matrix, a memory-powered AI agent framework. The goal of this document is to provide a clear path forward for the project, starting with a strategic rewrite of the existing TypeScript codebase into Go. This transition aims to enhance performance, improve concurrency, and create a more robust and scalable foundation for future development.

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## 2. High-Level Goals

*   **Improve Performance and Efficiency:** Leverage Go's performance characteristics to reduce latency and resource consumption, especially in high-throughput environments.
*   **Enhance Scalability:** Build a more scalable architecture that can handle a growing number of users, integrations, and data volume.
*   **Simplify Deployment:** Create a single, statically-linked binary for easier distribution and deployment across different platforms.
*   **Maintain Modularity:** Preserve the modular design of the original codebase to ensure flexibility and ease of maintenance.

## 3. Phase 1: TypeScript to Go Rewrite

The first major phase of this project is to rewrite the existing TypeScript codebase into Go. This will be a significant undertaking, and it will be approached in a structured manner to ensure a smooth transition.

### 3.1. Current TypeScript Architecture

The current codebase is well-structured and divided into two main parts:

*   **`src/app`:** The application layer, which includes the CLI, the API server, and the MCP (Model Context Protocol) handlers. This layer is responsible for handling user interactions and external communication.
*   **`src/core`:** The core business logic, which includes the "brain" (LLM integrations, memory, reasoning), storage (vector databases, session history), and other core functionalities.

### 3.2. Proposed Go Package Structure

The Go implementation will follow a similar package structure to maintain familiarity and ensure a clear separation of concerns. The proposed structure is as follows:

```
/matrix-go
  /cmd
    /matrix-cli         # Main application for the CLI
    /matrix-server      # Main application for the API server
  /internal
    /app
      /cli              # CLI command handlers and UI
      /server           # API server (HTTP handlers, middleware, routes)
      /mcp              # MCP handlers
    /core
      /brain            # LLM integrations, memory, reasoning
      /storage          # PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.
      /vectorstore      # Qdrant, Milvus, etc.
      /config           # Configuration loading and management
      /logger           # Logging utilities
  /pkg
    /mcp-sdk            # Shared MCP libraries
  go.mod
  ...
```

### 3.3. Key Modules for Rewrite

The following is a list of key modules from the TypeScript codebase that will be rewritten in Go. This is not an exhaustive list, but it represents the core components that need to be prioritized.

**Core Logic (`/internal/core`):**

*   **Configuration (`core/config`):** Loading and parsing of `matrix.yml`.
*   **LLM Providers (`core/brain/llm`):** Integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.
*   **Embedding Providers (`core/brain/embedding`):** Integrations for text embeddings.
*   **Vector Storage (`core/vector_storage`):** Clients for Qdrant and Milvus.
*   **Session Management (`core/session`):** Handling of user sessions.
*   **Memory System (`core/brain/memory`):** The core memory logic.
*   **Event System (`core/events`):** The event bus and event handling.

**Application Layer (`/internal/app`):**

*   **CLI (`app/cli`):** The command-line interface.
*   **API Server (`app/api`):** The REST API for external integrations.
*   **MCP Handler (`app/mcp`):** The Model Context Protocol implementation.

## 4. Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Placeholder)

Once the Go implementation is complete and stable, Phase 2 will focus on performance optimization. This will involve:

*   **Benchmarking:** Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.
*   **Concurrency Tuning:** Optimizing the use of goroutines and channels.
*   **Memory Profiling:** Analyzing and reducing memory usage.

## 5. Phase 3: Feature Enhancements (Placeholder)

Phase 3 will focus on adding new features and capabilities to the Go-based version of Matrix. Potential features include:

*   **New LLM and Vector Store Integrations:** Expanding the list of supported services.
*   **Advanced Memory Strategies:** Researching and implementing new memory techniques.
*   **Improved Tooling:** Enhancing the CLI and other developer tools.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** Creating a system for third-party extensions.
